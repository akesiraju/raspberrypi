# Car control using Raspberry PI

* This project is a custom home built toy car with raspberry pi mounted 
on top of it.
* The pi runs a flask based web server that takes commands to drive\steer\brake\reset the car.
* The car has been assembled using various toy building components.

## TODO
* Add additional sensors to the car as required to enable auto pilot.
* Expand the web server for lag free experience.
* Expand the web server to support multiple cars.
